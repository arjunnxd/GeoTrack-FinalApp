GeoTrack is an intelligent road safety and emergency response application designed to enhance user safety by detecting nearby vehicle risks and providing real-time alerts.

The app allows users to sign in with registered credentials, share their live location on a mini-map, and access the main interface for vehicle detection. Based on the risk level of approaching vehicles, the system generates pop-up alerts, which are also stored in the alert history for reference.

In the event of a collision or emergency, users can instantly trigger the SOS button. Once activated, the SOS system counts down to avoid accidental triggers and allows cancellation if unnecessary. If not canceled, it automatically notifies emergency contacts, hospitals, and family members, ensuring rapid assistance. Emergency calls are placed, and location data is shared with responders, enabling faster intervention and improved chances of saving lives.

By integrating real-time tracking, risk detection, and automated SOS alerts, GeoTrack provides a seamless safety ecosystem for accident prevention and post-accident response.
